Created by addroddyn, 2016.

Current features:

- On start, it creates folders if it finds none present (CurrenDrive:\Items\CurentMonth\CurrentDay\)
- Form is single instance.
- It creates a list based on the txt files it finds in the folder
- It changes window size according to list
- Window position is changed based on taskbar location
- Has the ability to add new files and change list accordingly.
- Melts your eyes with colours I used for testing label sizes

Planned features:
- Deleting items
- Adding/displaying items for multiple days
- Reminders
- Icon change.

This project is now on hold for now, since deleting items would require restructuring the whole code.
