- It changes window size according to list
- Window position is changed based on taskbar location
- Has the ability to add new files and change list accordingly.
- Melts your eyes with colours I used for texting label sizes

Planned features:
- Deleting items

This project is now on hold indefinitely, since deleting items would require restructuring the whole code.
